### Hello üòª I'm Deka! Nice to meet you!

I have been making websites since July 1, 1999, beginning on a platform called Expage where, if you knew HTML, you typed it all in a small textbox and hoped for the best. There was no CSS as we know it now back then (elements were styled with [HTML attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute), most with the same name as their current CSS properties), you could only use fonts that most users would have locally because there were no webfonts, there was a huge difference between IE and Netscape which you had to take into account, among many other things that have improved since then... but your website was your own, and you were happy to stumble upon other's websites and see what information or point of view they had to offer. There was pride in the design and customization of each website (and having a very high hit count), something that is mostly gone today as personal websites have largely disappeared. I later moved on to platforms such as Tripod and Angelfire, which allowed more pure HTML customization as opposed to the pre-made no-code website template Expage was supposed to be used as.

As a result, I tend to lean towards the frontend side of development, but I still have a desire to work in and learn more about the backend (and have 4+ years of work experience being a full stack developer).

:customs: Prior to becoming a developer, I was a [TSA officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration#Employees) for 5+ years! The one skill that carried over the most was remaining calm under pressure, which to be honest, came more in handy as a developer than as a TSO. üõÇ
